This project is a demo application that showcases how to implement a simple drawing app using Jetpack Compose. The app allows users to draw on a canvas using their fingers, select different colors for drawing, and clear the canvas with a single tap. It highlights the power of Jetpack Compose for building highly interactive and dynamic UIs while following clean architecture principles.

Key Features:
Drawing on Canvas

Users can draw freehand using their fingers on the canvas.
The app leverages Jetpack Compose's Canvas API for real-time drawing.
Touch inputs are captured and processed to render smooth lines dynamically.
Color Picker

Users can choose from a palette of colors to customize their drawings.
The selected color is applied instantly to the brush for a seamless experience.
Clear Canvas

A dedicated "Clear Canvas" option allows users to erase all drawings, resetting the canvas to its initial state.
This functionality is integrated with minimal latency for a smooth user experience.
State Management

The app uses StateFlow to manage the drawing state efficiently, ensuring reactivity and consistency.
The drawing operations are processed and managed in a dedicated DrawingViewModel, which separates business logic from UI components.
Clean Architecture

The app follows the principles of clean architecture, making it modular and easy to maintain:
ViewModel: Manages the drawing state, selected color, and canvas operations (clear, draw, etc.).
CanvasControl Class: Encapsulates the logic for managing the canvas and interpreting touch inputs.
UI Components: Jetpack Compose-based UI components to provide a modern, intuitive interface.
Jetpack Compose

The project uses the latest Jetpack Compose version, showcasing best practices and up-to-date APIs.
It simplifies building complex UIs like the drawing canvas with minimal boilerplate code.
Why Use This Project?
This project serves as a practical example of building interactive features in Jetpack Compose while maintaining clean and scalable code. It's a great starting point for developers looking to explore touch interaction handling, custom drawing on canvas, and reactive state management in modern Android apps.
